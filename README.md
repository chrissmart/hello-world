# hello-world
To review the use of Git and Git Hub, this repository will help a lot.

I'm Chris, a novice at coding but with passion for it.
Always, people have a dream of changing the world, so do I but in a different way hopefully.
Internet brings people from reality to somewhere mixed with reality and virtuality, 
and I believe, the way of viewing thiw world changes much rapidly than those pioneers expected initially.
So, in response to this, I'm in this virtual screen to dig into an unknown world where changing the world become fun and unique.
